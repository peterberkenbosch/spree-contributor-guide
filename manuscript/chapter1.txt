# Hello Contributor - welcome to Spree!

You’re here to help, great. We’re here to help you help us.

Before you start, we’ll ask you to do a bit of reading.
You will find all you need in this book. Don't worry, it's not much :)

* Contributor guidelines
* Style issues, we’ve got your back. Have a look here.
* Not sure what to work on?
* Rules! We’ve got rules. We really want your help, but we’ve got some standards to uphold. Please make sure your contribution doesn’t break any of these.

Phew, now that that’s out of the way, what are you waiting for? Start contributing!
